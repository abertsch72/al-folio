I am a first-year masters student in the [Language Technologies Institute](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by [Matt Gormley](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mgormley/). 

My research interest is in conditional text generation, especially for summarization. I'm interested in building more interpretable, faithful models that are robust to non-standard (e.g. informal or domain-specific) language. Currently, my work is in dialogue summarization.

I received my bachelors in math and computer science from the University of Arizona, where I was advised by [Steven Bethard](https://bethard.faculty.arizona.edu/).

In my spare time, I write and read speculative fiction and play tabletop games.
