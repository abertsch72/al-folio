I am a second-year masters student in the [Language Technologies Institute](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by [Matt Gormley](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mgormley/). I also work closely with members of [NeuLab](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~neulab/).

I work on summarization and other conditional text generation tasks. My research interests include better ways to reason over large quantities of knowledge, model large-scale structure in text, and effectively integrate external knowledge into models. Currently, my work is in long-doc and multi-doc summarization. 

I'm also broadly interested in meta-analysis of the NLP community, including critically examining the benchmarks, datasets, and modeling choices we take as defaults. Right now, some great collaborators and I are interviewing people about paradigm shifts in NLP; if you've published 3+ papers in NLP-related venues and you'd have time for a 60 minute interview, please reach out!

Before coming to CMU, I received my bachelors in math and computer science from the University of Arizona, where I was advised by [Steven Bethard](https://bethard.faculty.arizona.edu/).

In my spare time, I write and read speculative fiction and play tabletop games.
